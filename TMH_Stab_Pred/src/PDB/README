# TMH-Stab-Pred
>
>**TMH Stab- Pred** is a machine learning based tool designed to predict the stability of transmembrane helical proteins. In this work, we related sequence and structure-based parameters with free energy of alpha-helical membrane proteins.
>
>>Theoretically, **protein stability** is defined as the free energy difference between folded and unfolded states. The folded state free energy depends on contribution of different covalent and non-covalent interactions such as disulphide bonds, hydrophobic, electrostatic, van der Waals, and hydrogen-bonding whereas the unfolded state is dominated with conformational entropy. The contributions of these interactions are used to understand and predict the stability of globular proteins as well as identifying the stabilizing residues.

##
## **Requirements**

>>
>> or 
>>
>> Download the  foldX folder from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dbdgt5KFa_VmgMcqEj9oM7Fckzj5CKaK/view?usp=sharing
>> 
>>Python distribution

>> 4. pandas
>> 5. numpy

##
## **Tutorial**
> 1. Download the github repository and extract the folder titled (**TMH Stability Predictor**). *Input* and *src* are the two subfolders to look for.
>
> 2.  Placing the **.pdb** files in the *input folder* and making sure the file name ends in **.pdb** is required will allow the protein to anticipate their stability. (Missing extension gives **error 2**) (for the complete list of errors, refer possible error section below).
>
> 3. The ***foldX executable file and molecules folder*** should be added to the *src directory* in the **TMH Stability Predictor** folder after extracting (refer requirements section for foldx downloads).
>
> 4. In the *src directory*, look for the Python file ***run.py***; this programme doesn't require any command-line inputs.
>
> 5. Now open the terminal and go to the folder containing ***run.py***. To execute the prediction command code, enter any one of these commands:

                                         python run.py   or python3 run.py
>
> 6. After executing the code ***run.py***, check for any package installation or import errors. Before running the code again, try to install any missing packages that may have caused the error.
>
> 7. Several files were generated in the *src* folder once the code had begun to execute, and the final output, along with the predicted stability and computed features, was shown in the terminal and saved to the file ***final.csv***.
>
> 8. If you are unable to see the output, refer the possible error section for more details.

## **Possible errors**
error 1: Package/module not found 
> - (***solution: install the required python packages***) 

error 2: Enter Proper PDB File or PDB File missing in input folder 
> - (***solution: check the input for the presence of  PDB files and their naming should have .pdb extension***)

##
## Example
Download the folder from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C_Hb7PZl2VukUtYCPBlVZQDIQySWHffr?usp=share_link  and follow the tutorial from step 4
